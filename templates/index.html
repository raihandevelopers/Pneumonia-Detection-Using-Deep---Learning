<body>
This web application is based on a 2-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to recognise pneumonia on chest x-rays. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 86% on the relevant test set of more than 500 x-rays. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Therefore the model has limitations and cannot be used for definite clinical predictions! Instead it can be used for research and comparison purposes (please see notes below).
